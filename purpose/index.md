# **Purpose.** 

### **Vizzuality's purpose is to reach a fair and sustainable planet by creating tools that radically empower people to make positive changes now.**

This vision was accepted by consent in a whole-company workshop in May 2018. 

# Vision Statements

Vision statements are meant to be a more practical and measurable expression of the Purpose. Within five years, what would we like to achieve? It is intended that these statements help everyone at the company understand what we are aiming for, and also to help them make decisions about where to focus their energies. If you're doing a task and it isn't contributing to the vision, ask yourself how you can alter it so that it's helping us create the company we all want. 

We would like to propose four main visions for what we want to achieve in the next five years. 

1. 100 Million people are using our tools every year to understand the world and act to make it better

2. Our team is a unique assembly of capabilities and skills working together for a flourishing planet.

3. Our team is inspired by the projects we work on and we’re open and generous with our knowledge

4. Thousands of people follow us into a movement creating a more sustainable, equal and enjoyable way of doing business

An initial version of these statements was presented at Vizzcamp 2018, and using the feedback from the sessions and the comments coming out of the consent process we refined these statements. We received no blocking comments, only suggestions. You can see the initial statements, the comments we heard, and how we reflected those in our new visions, [in this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DW-VBXcWSFlFrvqnZUZALL4iT5G7tbxzXXBFUs23Dh4/edit)

## Strategic Priorities

We have two main priorities for the next six months. 

**1. Increase the urgency of our work and complete projects more quickly.**

Under this priority we will undertake five main activities

* The 6 systems we’re creating are built around increasing speed and quality and are consentmentized and operational by the end of 2018
* Build an organistional structure that empowers individual ownership of our work, rewarding positive behaviour and a drive towards our results	
* Build a strategy for better communication during meetings (including good practices and equipment)
* Hire staff with different skills/ backgrounds who can create new tools, data, research and ideas.
* Define internal training needs for our current staff to create new tools, data, research and ideas

**2. Win the largest, best, most impactful, and most profitable projects.**

Under this priority, we will undertake four main activities. 

* Work on 20 projects in 2019 with an average sized income of 200k (baseline is 32 projects with $103k average size)
* Win more grants to build our research team
* Extend our client base into Europe
* Investigate ways to change budget, rates, scope management or types of project to ensure we're setting ourselves up for profitability

**This is in order to double our per staff profit, so we're able to invest that new profit in more initiatives that achieve our purpose.**


## Additional priorities
There are a number of other strategic priorities that we want to focus on in the coming years. But we won't be able to do them until we've delivered these first two groups of priorities. Therefore we're using a classic Agile Backlog system. Once we have secured a greater source of funds for new initiatives, we will reopen the backlog and, using a consent process, include a few new priorities.
