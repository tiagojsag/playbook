# **Conflict Resolution.**

In this guideline we want to outline some guidance to help you prevent conflict in the first place, then some steps you can take when you have a conflict you want to resolve.

## Main principle.
_If you have a conflict you should resolve it. If you detect a conflict you must help the people involved. The responsibility for resolving our conflicts as a company, is shared._

## Prevention.

1. We use the Nonviolent Communication (NVC) process. This means being open to talk about times when our strategies violate or don't fulfill our colleague's needs. This means focussing on needs and objective things, not opinons. 
2. We don’t blame problems on others. If something doesn't go as we planned, it's a chance to learn and improve 
3. We take ownership for our thoughts, beliefs, words, and actions  
4. We don’t spread rumors
5. We don’t talk behind someone’s back
6. We focus on strengths

### More information onthe non-violent communication process.

At a series of workshops in May 2018, we all got the chance to learn the non-violent communication "dance". This involves going through a number of steps, with yourself on one side and the person who you have the conflict with on the other. 

1. Start with the situation. What is happening right now?
2. What are your thoughts? 
3. Observations; objective facts that you can 
4. What are your emotions/ feelings? Does this situation make you feel happy, sad, angry? 
5. What are your needs in this situation? Comfort, support, communication? 
6. Strategies. What strategies can you use that will meet the needs of both people? 

## Resolution.
If you find yourself in conflict with a client or a colleague, follow these steps

0. Go through the NVC process to identify yours and the other person/people/project/situation’s needs. See if there is a new strategy that meets both people's needs. Then implement it! 
1. If this does not solve the issue, or you'd like to discuss the problem in more detail with the person then sit with them 1-to-1 and sort out the matter privately. Again, use the NVC process to help find a strategy that works for all; listen before talking. 
2. (internal) If you can't find an agreeable solution then nominate a colleague that both parties trust to act as a mediator. The mediator doesn’t impose a decision. Rather they support the participants to come to their own solution
2. (external) If you have an external problem with a client and they couldn’t find and agreeable solution, they should raise their hand and approach the PM or other team members.
3. If mediation fails, the mediator has the responsibility to create a group of mediators (perhaps a group 3 people) who will then try to come up with an agreed decision

** Detecting Conflict **
Successful conflict resolution depends on people being aware of the conflicts they may create, and raising awareness about conflicts they're suffering. We encourage Vizzuality staff to seek a dialogue between colleagues - if you're not comfortable doing this in person, you could skip straight to step 2 with a trusted colleague. 

** Learning and Sharing **
We would like to propose a monthly session where staff can explain conflicts they or others have had, and how they were resolved. These sessions are important to help us all learn and prevent future misunderstandings or conflicts.

## Coming soon.

Next steps for this group include
- Setting up the monthly sessions
- Setting some guidance for mediators
- Train mediators/ build a conflict resolution committee
- TEST
