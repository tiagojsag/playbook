#**Claiming Expenses**

The expenses covered by Vizzuality depend on the type of travel and destination. So, we  have the following situations:

## Between offices - Madrid / Cambridge / Porto

Type of expenses paid by Vizzuality:
- Accommodation 
- Transportation ( Flights, trains, taxi…)

We don’t include expenses for meals because we have a kitchen in all three offices (fridge and microwave) so we consider that it’s not necessary.

## Other Places (USA for example)
Type of expenses paid by Vizzuality:

- Accommodation 
- Transportation ( Flights, trains, taxis)
- Expenses related with meals. We will pay the expenses you can justify with tickets/invoices up to 50$/day. It’s important to save all tickets , we won’t pay expenses without the corresponding ticket.

## Justification

It’s important to save all tickets , we won’t pay expenses without the corresponding ticket. 

After your trip, you should send all your tickets/invoices to Liuba and fill in the template attached here below. She will transfer the total amount at the end of the month with your payrolls.
