# Claiming Expenses

The expenses covered by Vizzuality depend on the type of travel and destination. So, we have the following situations:

## Between offices - Madrid / Cambridge / Porto

Type of expenses paid by Vizzuality:

* Accommodation 
* Transportation \( Flights, trains, taxi…\)

We don’t include expenses for meals because we have a kitchen in all three offices \(fridge and microwave\) so we consider that it’s not necessary.

## Other Places \(USA for example\)

Type of expenses paid by Vizzuality:

* Accommodation 
* Transportation \( Flights, trains, taxis\)
* Expenses related with meals. We will pay the expenses you can justify with tickets/invoices up to 50$/day. It’s important to save all tickets , we won’t pay expenses without the corresponding ticket.

## Justification

It’s important to save all tickets , we won’t pay expenses without the corresponding ticket.

After your trip, you should send all your tickets/invoices to Liuba and fill in the template attached here below. She will transfer the total amount at the end of the month with your payrolls.
