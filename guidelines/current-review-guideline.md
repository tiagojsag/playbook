# Review, Evaluation and Coaching guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines and best practices to establish a common conceptual framework and processes for effective goal setting and evaluation across the company.

This is work in progress and subject to change after discussions with the team.

## Setting goals and expectations

First of all make sure you are familiar with the goals and objectives for the team as a whole \[link to doc with [core competencies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ng6H8mzKMt98nUkeJofLgemHIoW2o2xPqZKaKq1Tz1Q/edit), purpose/vision of the company, etc\] and the key responsibilities and competencies of the person you’re going to supervise \[link to job family, job-specific competencies and KRAs\].

Talk to the exec team and to whoever is currently \(or has in the past been\) setting objectives, managing or overseeing that person.

Hold a "performance planning" session at the beginning of the term, to discuss that person’s goals and your expectations as well as explaining this process and making sure KRAs, competencies, goals, and the evaluation processes are understood.

Make sure you set the baseline for current and desired competencies and results. Define what success should look like. Set down Key Responsibility Areas and Key Performance Indicators if they don’t yet exist for that person. Check out that role’s set of competencies and how it matches against them.

* KRAs are just verb+name \(_write data rendering javascript code_\) with no implicit valuation.
* KPIs are about measuring KRAs in terms of quality, quantity, cost or timeliness and may be expressed as quantitative or descriptive \(like: _reduce to half the number of bugs in production code_\).
* Competencies describe the knowledge, skills, behaviors, attributes, abilities, and attitudes that are essential to achieving the results expected. A competency is a significant talent, skill, or proficiency that helps an individual generate superior performance.

Define goals and expectations as a combination of behavior and results:

-performance → result oriented → KPI \(or OKR?\) related

-development → behavior-oriented → competence related

Setting specific and difficult goals is better than just urging people to do their best. Clear deadlines for goal completion are better than loose ones. If you can’t set a tight deadline perhaps the goal needs to be broken down.

Goals should be set along with expected measurable outcomes and preferably a date. They shouldn’t focus on the means \(eg _attend a course or give a talk_\) but on the outcome \(eg _get a skill or ability, perform to a certain measure_\)

Keep it simple, no more than 3-4 goals per term plus the normal expectations of the position are more than enough.

It’s important that goals are shared and assumed, and your team should be comfortable with publicly \(or at least privately to you if they are personal\) committing to them.

When setting goals it is useful to ask ourselves 4 questions:

* What do we want and don’t have \(achieve\)
* What do we have and want \(preserve\)
* What we don’t have and don’t want \(avoid\)
* What do we have and don’t want \(eliminate\)

Some initial sources of effective goals:

* Things that help get a better quality
* Things that help get a higher impact
* Things that help the team as a whole to work better and achieve the points
* Things that open new business opportunities or create new core competencies in the organization.
* Things that help the person develop or enhance their competencies
* Things that help reduce cost, time and effort

## One-on-Ones and coaching

During the term you should regularly have one-on-ones and coaching sessions with your team. These can be informal but are different from the casual coffee machine chat. You should plan for them, make them actionable and document the outcomes - they will come handy later on.

### One on One

These are informal but scheduled conversations to talk about whatever comes up. Always listen first, and if nothing comes up, you can chat about things like:

**Daily work**: Anything bothering you? Roadblocks? Things that are working better?

**Team collaboration and relations**: who’s rocking it in your team? Who helps you out? How? How can we improve teamwork?

**Happiness**: Are you happy working here? Are you happy with your recent work? Why or why not?

**Short-term goals**: How are projects going? What can we do to help? What are the main bottlenecks? Can we do anything to move it along? What are the projects you would be interested in working on next?

**Long-term goals**: How do you think about your progress on your goals? What needs to be done to move towards the goals? What can we do to help?

**Personal development**: Do you feel like you are learning at work? What are the new things you learned lately? What are the areas you want to learn about?

Whom in the team do you want to learn from?

**Feedback**: What can we do to make your work easier? How can we support you better?

What is something we could have done better?

### Coaching

In many cases, you will feel that the person could benefit from your experience to achieve goals and get competencies. In these cases, coaching is an effective support tool where you can put your experience in context to help them develop. Remember, coaching is not training, and before someone can benefit from it they should be properly trained for the job.

Coaching someone involves the following functions:

**Giving advice** to help them improve their performance. Giving advice doesn’t mean telling the person how to do the job, but offering suggestions based on your experience. For effective advice it is imperative that you **listen** to the person’s concerns and opinions

Providing **guidance** so that they can develop their skills and knowledge appropriately.

Providing **support** \(but being there only when your presence is needed\). It involves being available when they need help, but not monitoring and controlling the person’s every move. The responsibility for improving is theirs.

Giving **confidence** as a positive feedback that allows people to feel confident about what they’re doing and how they’re doing it, as well as letting them know about areas where they need to improve.

Helping them gain greater **competence** by guiding them toward acquiring more knowledge and sharpening their skills so that they are better prepared for more complex tasks and higher-level roles.

## Writing the review

Some time before the face-to-face review, go over other notes you’ve kept during the term from the planning meeting, the one-on-ones and your own observations \(like a well-executed project, a deadline missed or handling a difficult client\). Also, ask them to jot down a few things they’ve done over the last year that they’re proud of, and their general feelings about how they did. Ask for feedback from others in the company who work closely with them. The larger the number of independent evaluations the better.

Record your observations and judgments about their performance as objectively as possible, and tie your conclusions to hard data including speciﬁc examples:

* Details about what you observed.
* Supporting data, such as indicators, reports or team feedback
* The impact on the team and organization
* The degree of accomplishment of their goals

Expressing your observations as neutral facts rather than judgments is particularly important when giving negative feedback. When giving positive feedback, on the other hand, it’s ok to combine speciﬁc achievements with character-based praise.

\[TBD\] Use your judgment to rank the person in a scale from 1 to 5, where 3 means that person actually did all that was expected from them \(met goals and expectations\) \[link to rank explanation goes here\]

Note: we need to do some work here to figure out if we want a ranking system, how complex it should be and how we’d use it.

Hold a calibration session with your peer reviewers and the executive team. We need to make sure we normalize reviews before handing them out.

## Communicating the review

A couple of hours before the meeting you should have shared a copy of your review with them, so they can prepare and your conversation can be focused on the outstanding items. The majority of the conversation should go about things the person has done well, however, do not sugarcoat bad news.

After discussing the strengths and achievements \(and also the issues\), ask how they feel about how things are going and listen carefully to their response, taking notes if necessary.

Then give feedback \(a "stop, start, and continue" model often works well\):

What are they doing now that is not working? \(what should stop\)

What are they doing that is highly effective? \(what should continue\)

What actions should they take to be more so? \(what should start\)

Focus on behaviors, not dispositions. Give specific advice and targeted praise. Don’t say: ‘You need to be more proactive.’ but something like: ‘You need to take more initiative in solving bug reports and informing the team.'
