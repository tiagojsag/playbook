## Professional Guidance

_The purpose of this guideline is to make sure there is a way for Vizzuality people to receive support \(guidance\) in their professional growth._

How does it work? It’s pretty simple. Choose a guide, then every 3 months have a conversation to define and review your objectives and results. This is an opportunity to celebrate what you’ve achieved and also think carefully about what comes next. Repeat forever.

### Principles

* It is driven by you, not a boss. A guide supports you rather than tells you what to do.
* It should be regular and consistent.
* This doesn’t replace regular daily/weekly/monthly feedback from your team.
* Everyone in the company choose their guide.
* We will predefine a pool of volunteer guides
* This isn’t a process to review performance or define salaries/bonuses; rather it’s about supporting professional growth.
* In one year we will review if it’s working. If it’s not we can revise it or completely change, but everyone must at least try it out for a year.

### How it will work

1. Identify a guide to help with your objectives \(typically someone with more experience and someone schooled in being a guide\) and publish who it is in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1urS7K81ZPrThY9foclGUa5XxMKGhu7E2AcwX1x1TkGQ/edit#gid=966584708)
2. Set quarterly/biannual objectives and results yourself and review with the guide. Making sure they are results driven, measurable etc. see below for details in how to write objectives.
3. Once objectives and results have been set, publish publicly by default unless there is a strong reason not to.
4. After each quarter,
   * On your own, score each result 0-1 then
   * Arrange a meeting with your guide.
   * During the meeting discuss what went well, what didn't, what was missed and why.
   * Go away and create new/adjust results and objectives for the next quarter
   * Arrange another 30 mins meeting with guide
   * In meeting, check results and obj, checking they are good and can be measured in 3 months time. Also check how realistic they are and if others need to be involved. Also use checklist below to help.
   * Publish and Repeat
   * Regularly have one-to-ones with your guide and/or peers.

### Working with the existing feedback review process

This is tbd pending a new feedback process. This section will be updated once that is agreed. In the interim:

If you have a working review process in place, carry on until the new feedback guidelines are complete. There is one important part that will change. **Objectives \(sometimes known as goals in the review process\) should only be written and shared as part of the guidance process.** This is to avoid confusion and duplication of work. Of course you can use what you have learnt in the feedback review to help inform your objectives for the guidance.

If you are happy to use the guidance process in place of the review process, that is okay too. If you do that, it is advised you make sure the reviews are not forgotten and the knowledge in your current reviewers are not ignored. Therefore, for the first round of guidance meetings, it is recommended that your previous reviewers are there too. After the first meeting, the current reviewer will step back and your guide will continue. In some cases it might actually be the same person, in which case the main difference will be the way in which guidance is carried out.

### Other details

* For guides, we will offer mentoring and training in how to guide effectively
* For everyone, we will offer guidance on how to write objectives and results and get the most out of the process
* Most of the time a guide will be a Vizzuality staff member, if there isn’t someone  suitable internally \(typically for specialist knowledge\) we can look for an external guide.

## How objectives and results work and could be written

Each quarter, before meeting with your guide, you will write down what you want in your professional life in the form of objective and results. Why this way? It’s a format used widely across many organisations that allows you to capture what you want to aspire to with some stepping stone results along the way. They’re often referred to as OKRs.

### What should objectives be about?

Objectives should be around your professional growth:

* continuing to learn new skills and practices,
* improving job performance,
* increasing duties and responsibilities,
* participating in professional organisations.

### How to write objectives with key results

The objective is a high-level statement, typically referring to either something you want to achieve or something you want to become; the common element is a direction or action. Something increases, or decreases, gets faster, slower, is launched, released. For example:

* Increase my technical leadership capabilities from those of a mid-level to a senior
* Increase the code quality across all of our projects
* Reduce the number of bugs in GFW
* Increase the speed of wireframe review process in World bank Maps
* Improve my skills at presenting to clients
* Learn how to talk to the company in Spanish
* Reduce the amount of senior developer interventions on my code in i2i
* Reduce the time by half that it takes to produce financial reports
* Treble the number of companies referencing Vizzuality in their marketing
* Increase the income from grant bodies by 400k
* Increase the number of people forking and talking about Vizzuality’s open source projects

Notice all these objectives have a few things in common.

* They are very active statements, mostly directional, sometimes action based. They are either about improving yourself or improving something else.
* They are all achievable, some more ambitious than others. I’d always err on the side of more ambitious.
* The statements are also unambiguous: there is an element of precision in them \(‘by 20%....’, ‘across 100% of projects’....\)
* Note, they can be about projects, but importantly they are about what you would do on a project.

As stated above, the success or failure to reach these objectives are not directly tied to salary so please, be ambitious! We are trying to save nature and slow climate change. That takes ambition!

You will notice that each of these objectives are not especially measurable, that is where the results come in. Under each objective there are a set of results. This is a statement of what you plan to achieve in order to reach the objectives. Think of them as a series of stepping stones, typically a more measurable result to achieve. Here are some examples based on the above objectives.

**Objective x. Increase my technical leadership capabilities from those of a mid-level to a senior**

* Result 1. In 3 months I will have completed a mentoring training course and an intern is  mentored successfully.
* Result 2. In 3 months I have lead the architectural design of a major feature of GFW and published to production.
* Result 3. In 1 month there is a blog post describing how we implemented the Mapbox GL library into the layer manager.

**Objective y. Deliver Half-Earth Mapping Platform to the highest possible standard**

* Result 1. Every week all features have been reviewed and estimated and the client is aware.
* Result 2. In 1 month I have successfully organised and run a design sprint with clear outputs produced.
* Result 3. The final release is online without any launch stopping bugs 2 weeks before the launch date.

**Objective z. Increase the code quality of all our projects**

* Result 1. By February there is agreed guidance for standardised coding practices across all teams.
* Result 2. All projects I work on have a &gt;60% unit test coverage
* Result 3. 100% code written in all k-team projects follow the pull request model outlined in the guidance document

Notice a few things in the results. All have a time frame. All can be scored if you need to, either by a binary 0 \(fail\) or 1 \(success\) or a gradation 0.5 \(I did half of what the result stated\). All should be ambitious but at least partly achievable. All should be specific. All are results, **not tasks**. I’ll try and explain that:

* **A task is:** Next Tuesday I will write a guidance document about code quality.
* **A result is:** There is a guidance document available in the vizzuality playbook about code quality.

It may seem like language trickery, and in some cases, it kind of is. However the idea of making it results-focused is to make sure you have multiple ways to achieve an output. How you do it is up to you. What you plan to create is the thing that is fixed. In some cases it might require multiple people to achieve the result. That is fine.

### Checklist for your Objectives and Results

#### Objectives

* Does the objective have direction and/or action \(Increase, Decrease, - Faster, Slower, Reduce, Deliver etc\)
* Does the objective contain something about improving yourself or something else?
* Is it achievable in the short-mid term?
* Is it ambitious?
* Is it unambiguous?

#### Results

* Is there a time element \(‘...by May...’, ‘In 3 weeks...’, ‘Every day…’, ‘In 3 months…’ etc\)
* Can you measure it either in a binary way or a scale \(‘100%  of x is done’, ‘3 sprints are complete…’ etc\)
* Is it difficult but achievable within 3 months?
* Make sure it’s not a task, rather a result.
* Can you look at it in 3 months and understand what is means.
* Is it legible, Could Craig understand it? Could a non-expert understand it?

#### Things still to write/do:

* A training programme for the guides.
* Identify the guides.
* Build this into the HR position
* When to change guides
* Create a list of external guides we can call upon. \(Note this is different to training\)
* Model the cost of external guides.
* Define and test where to publish the goals.
* Write Salary and bonuses guidance.
