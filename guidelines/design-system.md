## Design system.

Creating a design system not only helps your team produce more consistent user experiences, it also builds bridges between design and development. By creating a common visual language codified through design tokens, and a set of components and patterns cataloged in a UI library, you’ll vastly improve designer/developer communication. You’ll also have fine-tuned control of the UI in a way that is manageable, scalable, and robust. Regardless of the technologies and tools behind them, a successful design system follows these guiding principles:

* **It’s consistent.** The way components are built and managed follows a predictable pattern.
* **It’s self-contained.** Your design system is treated as a standalone dependency.
* **It’s reusable.** You’ve built components so they can be reused in many contexts.
* **It’s accessible.** Applications built with your design system are usable by as many people as possible, no matter how they access the web.
* **It’s robust.** No matter the product or platform to which your design system is applied, it should perform with grace and minimal bugs.

### Introduction

The first thing you should do is to ask yourself some questions that need to be clear before you start designing:

* What’s the goal of this tool \(you’re about to build\)?
* What do you know about the brand?
* What’s the scope of the project? The aim of this question is to find the best approach to face a project. Is it a prototype? Are we going to deliver a tool we’re not going to be taking care of? Is this an ongoing project? \(how much\) Do we have to innovate? What do they expect from us? What value do we need to add ... 
* Which questions does it have to answer?
* Which are its’ users?

### Design Principles

Here some Design Principles we \(as Vizzuality\) should always meet that we also should bespoke for every project we do: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/17fxCrPVurVXRNkpZHsM9oVdGebj8so-uFR0n73GZETw/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17fxCrPVurVXRNkpZHsM9oVdGebj8so-uFR0n73GZETw/edit)

### Understand Users

Be sure that the site/designs we created meet their needs. Without users, your design wouldn’t exist. Acceptance tests doc: [https://vizzuality.github.io/playbook/projects/stories-and-acceptance-tests/](https://vizzuality.github.io/playbook/projects/stories-and-acceptance-tests/)

## Wireframe template.

Wireframe base sketch: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/nm1f3ykle33utcd/Wireframe\_base.sketch?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nm1f3ykle33utcd/Wireframe_base.sketch?dl=0)

### How to use it?

This is an internal tool to help designers build in a more efficient way different wireframes 1. Copy the sketch file 2. Rename it following the file naming guideline in “Folder and file architecture” 3. Design in the ‘Wireframe’ page helped by the created symbols and templates \(for further information about how to use symbols, consult [Symbols in the Sketch documentation](https://sketchapp.com/docs/symbols/)\)

### How to present it

To give context or further explanations to the wireframe when sharing it, here you are some PDF as a reference and templates to build the presentation: [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/t3fulazhja31new/AABuqP23lJvc8JxF4DdeBI8\_a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/t3fulazhja31new/AABuqP23lJvc8JxF4DdeBI8_a?dl=0)

## UI Kit Template.

There is a UI Kit template we’ve created and that should be used for the rest of designers during the design process. The sooner there’s a visual design line defined \(in a difference with the exploration phase\) the better. Using this UI Kit soon will save time and avoid future inconsistencies.

**Resource Watch UI Kit library sketch:** [https://www.dropbox.com/s/k9xno3h9gbft8sr/RW\_UIKit.sketch?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k9xno3h9gbft8sr/RW_UIKit.sketch?dl=0) \(for further information about how to use libraries, consult [Libraries in the Sketch documentation](https://sketchapp.com/docs/libraries/)\)

**Prototype Demo:** [https://invis.io/TVPDD7BZYKS\#/240485596\_UI\_Kit](https://invis.io/TVPDD7BZYKS#/240485596_UI_Kit) \(for further information about how to send your designs into InVision, consult ['Introduction to Craft Sync'](https://support.invisionapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/210310026-Introduction-to-the-Craft-Sync-plugin)\)

### How to use it?

* We should upload the UI Kit on InVision with the rest of the design screens, preferable to have all the groups and name of the assets under control.
* As we \(and that’s something we should push internally\) will work with symbols and libraries it’s easier for everyone to acknowledge if there is something new on the design, or if we've decided to change/adapt the UI.
* Make sure every asset is exportable with the needed format \(svg, png..\)
* Design button states \(we could agree that with the dev.\). 
* All the icons should be in black and we should contain them inside a standardized box size. \(16px, 24px…\). 
* For colors it’s not important to add the name of each one of them, what it is actually needed is the alpha colors we are working with.
* Specify the layout for each design we deliver. 
* Create a navigation through the different UI kit elements for mobile and desktop.
* Tipo. =&gt; Work with styles

### Extra notes:

* We always missed important inputs status: \(Disabled, Placeholder, Focus, Validation + messages\)
* Maybe not for this phase, but it would be great if we can work with grids/baseline.
