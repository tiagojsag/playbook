The Cycle Scheme enables employees to obtain a high value bike that they be unable to afford if they were to pay the cost up front themselves. The employer/organization pays for the bike and “hires” it out to the employee. The employer claims their hire fee over 12 months from the employee by making deductions from the employee’s gross pay. The amount claimed back from the employee is the entire value of the bike spread over a period of twelve months. The Scheme can be implemented for as little as one member of staff and provides savings for both the business and the employee.

Example : Employee takes a £1000 bike \(maximum budget\) over 12 months which is tax and NI free and therefore makes a 32% saving \(20% tax 12%NI\). \(1000/12\)/100 x 32 = £26.67 \(saving per month\) £26.67 x 12= £319.99\(saving per annum in tax and NI contributions\) As an employee you make a 32% saving on a cost that you would have to otherwise pay.
