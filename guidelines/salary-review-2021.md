## Salary Review 2021

### Overview:

* Everyone at Vizz has to do a Self Reflection exercise in preparation for the salary conversation they will have with the Exec during Q1-Q2 2021.
* The guideline below was consented by the team on 19th January 2021, following a group consent decision making proposal \(23 Consent, 0 Objections\)
* This proposal will be in place only during the current salary conversations \(Q1 & Q2 2021\) as we will be working in an improved process for next year.

Proposal: For the original proposal please [click here](https://vizzuality.blogin.co/posts/proposal-unfreezing-salary-conversations-117958)

## Purpose \(Why\)

In a self - organising team like ours, the degree to which we can each understand and manage our own performance and development will determine whether or not we succeed as an organisation.

More specifically, this initiative will allow you/us:

* To raise your own awareness and understanding in regards to your contributions to our purpose, culture, projects, and peers.
* To connect your day to day contributions to your salary review/increase \(if applicable\)
* To take a few steps forward as a company to increase our sense of accountability \(2021 Strategy Planning Survey Results - Priorities\)

To achieve the above, you will be invited to do a Personal Retrospective / Self Reflection about your 2020 contributions and added value, and to then have a conversation with one member of the Exec Team.

The whole point of doing this is to create the space to recognise and celebrate the great things you are doing for the company, your team and yourself. And also to reflect on how to improve your performance, continue learning and growing, and also helping Vizzuality achieve its purpose.

## The Process

As you can see on the image below, the great majority of the process is still the same as before \(5 Steps\).

The only thing which is changing is an extra step at the very beginning of the process which is intended to help you better prepare to face the process and the conversation you will have with the Exec Team about your salary review.

The act of preparing and self reflecting is intended to offer you a tool to empower you to have a better understanding of your contributions, performance and growth, and therefore to have a better and more informed salary conversation.

## What do I need to do?

You will be preparing a Self Reflection about your last year’s contributions to Vizzuality’s purpose, culture, projects, teams, peers, etc.

The activity will require you to stop, reflect and notice what you do at work, your contributions, and what you think that is worth to the company and our purpose.

To support you during the reflection exercise, you will be given a set of questions for you to think about. Some of those questions will be optional, but it's recommended you try to reflect on all of them to deepen your understanding.

\(\*\) [Self Reflection Template & Guiding Questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sb08poKFwuhzktCQ38WmXgi2RSstzRIn02aXWfLaxR8/edit)

When you have completed your self reflection, you should discuss it with one member of the Executive Team. \(If you have decided to take notes of your self reflection, please feel free to share them in advance of your conversation and/or to take your notes to the session.\)

Following your conversation, the Exec Team member will validate and calibrate your proposal with the rest of the Exec Team. After the calibration/validation exercise, you will receive a confirmation from the Exec Team on your final raise. The finance team will update your details and only then your salary raise will be effective in your payslip.

Who do I talk to? Which member of the Exec team is my point of contact for this conversation?

The whole point of these conversations is to create an open, trusting and comfortable space to talk about your salary and growth at Vizz. So, depending on your specific case and preferences this could mean that when having finished your self reflection:

* You reach out to the Exec team member who has always been your point of contact when it comes to salary raises because you feel comfortable talking with him.
* You reach out to the Exec team member you trust the most today.

If you have any doubts about this guideline, please feel free to reach out to me \(People & Culture\) and I will help you.
