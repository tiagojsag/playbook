## Organising a Lightning Talk :zap:
This guideline shows the steps to follow after you have decided to organise a lightning talk (i.e. it does not cover the steps to decide if you should give a lightning talk).
As the organiser of a Lightning talk there are a few steps to follow to make sure it goes as you expect. 
### 1. Scheduling the lightning talk
It is up to you for how long you want to schedule the lightning talk. 
If you want to make sure certain people are available on the time slot you have in mind use the Google Calendar web app to see these people availability (they might be out of the office or in a full day workshop or it might be a bank holiday in one of the offices). 
### 2. Sending the invites out
Once you have decided on the time slot, use your calendar to send the invites to all. 
### 3. Booking the meeting room in Madrid (optional)
Even if you will be presenting remotely, you might wish to use the material from the meeting room in Madrid (TV and Owl). If so, follow the guidelines to book the meeting room.
If you are not in Madrid, delegate on someone (and let them know) to set up the material on time. 
### 4. Getting food for the Madrid office (optional)
If you have chosen to schedule the talk during the 2-3pm slot, as the organiser, it is your responsibility to decide if you will request food. Inform on your decision to order food for the lightning talk the previous day in the #madrizz channel. Three hours before to the start of the lightning talk inform Liuba or Laura of the number of people that will be attending to then order food.
