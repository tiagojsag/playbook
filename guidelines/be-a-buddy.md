# Being a great buddy

You should be assigned to your buddy by the team who hired that person the week before they arrive. Ideally you would work in a similar role to the new starter, so you can provide support at work and getting all the different systems to setup.

You \(and they\) will receive tasks to complete via Bamboo; make sure to tick them off once you complete them!

Before their first day, try to link up with the team they'll work in and make sure they have work to do in the first week. Here's a few things you should do in the first day and first week to make sure our new friend gets up to speed as soon as possible:

* give them a tour of the office: toilets, fridge, coffee machine, re-stocking everything
* Give the new one an awesome t-shirt!!
* introduce them to everyone on slack
* take them for lunch as much as possible in the first week so they get to know everyone
* Make sure they read these guidelines!
* Point them to the intranet pages about their projects/ the company
* show them our vizzuality spotify playlist and suggest they join \#music if they like music
