#**Accounts to setup in your first week**

As soon as possible, you should create accounts for these applications:

Google App - this will take care of email, calendar and everything else
Pivotal Tracker - for task allocation within projects (talk to your team)
Slack - for internal communication. Don't forget to download the desktop app!
Teamweek - work planning across the company (ask your buddy to invite you)
Github - code repos. Make sure you are added to the vizzuality team.
Basecamp - client comms + project-wide discussions (talk to your team about the camps you should be on)
Lastpass for teams  - we use this to store and share passwords securely (talk to David G).
Set public keys for all servers. Please talk to your PM for this (developers only)

**Don't forget to set up two-factor authentication!**
2-step verification adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring you to sign in with something you know (your password) and something you have (a code sent to your phone). I recommend using googles Authenticator app rather than SMS. If you have any doubts about this please talk with David G.
turn on 2 factor authentication in your vizzuality.com and simbiotica.es accounts (https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?vid=1-635810371168859861-1666623466&rd=1)
turn on 2 factor authentication in github (you can use the same google app for codes)
