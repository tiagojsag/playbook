#  How to book a meeting room in Madrid

This guideline covers the protocol to book any of the meeting rooms in the Madrid office:
- Meeting room (Madrid)
- Meeting room (Forest)

## Material available

### Meeting room (Madrid)
- TV set (HDMI cable with thunderbolt adaptor) 
- Meeting Owl (USB 3 connection)

### Meeting room (Forest)
- Jabbra microphone (Bluetooth and USB3)
- Logitech camera (USB3)

Each meeting room has a Google calendar that anyone at Vizzuality can read and edit. 
## Subscribe to the Google Calendars
These steps to subscribe to a calendar via the Google Calendar web should only be done the first time: 

 1. on the left panel next to `Other calendars` click on the `+` sign
 2. select `Subscribe to calendar`
 3. search for `meeting`

Repeat to subscribe to both calendars. 

## Book a meeting room
Via the Google Calendar web check the availability of the meeting rooms by enabling their calendars. Drag in the calendar the desired slot. In the pop up select the calendar of the room of interest. From here it is also possible to invite all the people involved in the meeting. It is also possible to create the event in your own calendar and invite the Meeting Room of choice. Either way, it is important to double check the correct meeting room has been booked. 

## Change meeting room or cancel booking
Via the Google Calendar web edit the event and change the calendar it belongs to. The change can be to the other meeting room (make sure you check the availability) or to your own calendar (this will cancel the booking). 

## Booking conflict
If when checking the calendar to book there is no availability, check who is the organiser and drop them a line.
