# Core Principles of Feedback at Vizz

## Why give feedback?

Feedback helps us improve in some aspects of our work. This can manifest for us as:

* Becoming more self-aware of strengths & weaknesses
* Improving technical skills
* Surfacing more opportunities for knowledge sharing
* Building effective connections between workmates
* Increasing efficiency
* Developing openness

Ultimately we would like there to be a culture in the company, where people feel comfortable giving impartial feedback and can effectively act upon advice when given.

## Goals

General Criteria to be met:

* Creation of feedback guidelines with everybody participating!
* Focus on rich and frequent feedback
* Must be applicable/useful to the contexts from earlier
* More horizontal, less top-down.
* More open
* To be implemented using Champions/Ambassadors
