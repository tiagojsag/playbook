# Core Principles of Feedback at Vizz

## Why give feedback?

Feedback helps us improve in some aspects of our work. This can manifest for us as:

- Becoming more self-aware of strengths & weaknesses
- Improving technical skills
- Surfacing more opportunities for knowledge sharing
- Building effective connections between workmates
- Increasing efficiency
- Developing openness

Ultimately we would like there to be a culture in the company, where people feel comfortable giving impartial feedback and can effectively act upon advice when given.
