# Formal Review Process

## Overview

We have made a lot of progress towards addressing how ongoing feedback will be implemented at Vizzuality, but we are yet to elucidate how formal reviews will be carried out, mainly in the context performance reviews.

Note that here we will use the terms _formal review / performance review_ interchangeably to refer to any review process used in appraisal situations \(i.e. negotiating a pay-rise\).

## Defining Summative Feedback

First, it is useful to define formative \(_ongoing_\) and summative \(_end of line_\) feedback more clearly.

What is the distinction? If we can identify the differences, we can identify elements that we can take from the formative system and what elements need to be altered.

Here, formal reviews are a summative mode of feedback whose goal is to collect evidence in order to assess progress or competence. Typically, summative feedback is characterised by being:

* _Linear_

  i.e. not a feedback _loop_ \(at least not in the short-term\)

* _Long term_
* _Retrospective_

  Whereas ongoing feedback should be timely, giving advice as soon as possible, fomrative tends to collect evidence over a longer period of time in order to make some kind of assesment

* _Assessment Tool_

  i.e. measured against some competencies. Remember that competencies can have vertical bands \(objective, binary skill checks: “I can do X, Y, Z”\) and horizontal gradients \(subjective, analogue: “I can do X well, without difficulty, etc”\)

* _Identifying Future Objectives_

  Should be used to formulate long term goals that would take significant time to achieve.

## Relation to Core Competencies

See Vizz [core comps document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ng6H8mzKMt98nUkeJofLgemHIoW2o2xPqZKaKq1Tz1Q/edit).

We need to make this as objective as possible \(_verticality_\) and introduce some kind of proficiency scale \(_horizonatality_\), condence, and convert into a simple grid.

Verticality describes a binary checklist of skills that some employee can demonstrate in their particular role:

> _i.e._ "_I can do x, y, z_"

For example:

> "_I can add/update endpoints on the api_"

These should be objective skills that any employee either can or can't do, and be related to thier role.

Horizontality \(_I swear this is a word_\) describes a sliding scale of ability in any particular skill.

> _i.e._ _"I can do x well, need to improve y, and z extremely well"_

The latter could use ongoing feedback as evidence for progression along any skills horizontal axis.
