# Feedback Loops at Vizzuality: Giving Effective Feedback

## _Overview_

The idea here is to lay out a set of principles that should be universally applied when giving and taking feedback, regardless of the context that feedback is being given or received, and should be used as a guideline for both participants in the process.

## Nurturing a Culture

The goals are:

* Everyone is comfortable and open.
* We address challenges together.
* We have clear expectations.
* There's no such thing as a stupid question.
* There are ongoing positive and/or corrective processes for everyone.
* We all make it a priority to improve each other and the whole organization. 

Every day, we should aim to improve ourselves, the company, and offer useful feedback to our peers.

### When to Give Feedback?

Ideally you should give somebody informal feedback to someone you are working with once each day. The first step towards doing this is recognising opportunities to give feedback:

* _During handovers_

  Handovers between functional groups are likely to surface opportunities for rich feedback. Bridging the gap in understanding between researchers, designers, data-scientists, and devs is core to becoming more productive and efficient so try go give feedback that can aid smooth these transitions.

* _When you see good work being done!_

  Positive feedback is essential to making sure we keep on doing what we're awesome at.

* _When you recognise an opportunity for improvement_

  More on this below.

* _At the end of a sprint_

  How could teh sprint have run more smoothly? Feedback between you and your PM could well improve productivity of future sprints.

## What to give Feedback about?

Try to choose talking points that are relevant to current work/projects, and ensure that your points aren’t all negative ones!

Feedback is most useful to someone when likelihood of improvement is high. So it is important to identify what areas are more appropriate to give feedback on - some are more difficult than others! Consider the following:

```text
(easy)    Technical Skills

  Ʌ       Working Practices (e.g. Time Management)
  |
  |       Knowledge
  |
  |       Attitudes
  |
  V       Habits

(hard)    Personality
```

Try to focus on easier topics and successes that are likely to get the biggest positive returns in a reasonable time frame.

## Giving Feedback Effectively

These principles are concerned with how to give feedback effectively:

1. **Feedback needs to be shared** _**frequently**_ **and in** _**context**_**.**

   This is probably the most important set of principles to work under. There are two ways that ‘in context’ can be interpreted. Both are important!

   _Time-context_:

   You should aim to discuss recent topics. Trying to improve on something that happened two weeks ago will always be more difficult than when the event is fresh in the mind and can be acted upon immediately. Giving feedback little and often achieves this.

   _Topic-context_:

   Also, always aim to ensure that your discussion sticks to the point. Don’t go off on tangents and talk about unrelated issues. Find the core of what you want to discuss, reduce it down to only a few key points, and stick to them. Be clear and direct.

2. **Aim to achieve a specific outcome, needs to be realistic in its expectations.**

   Discuss next steps together, ensuring that the goals outlined are achievable within a reasonable time frame. Don’t be afraid to block goals into smaller chunks or waypoints. Larger, more abstract goals \(“you should improve your cooking skills”\) should be matched with smaller, clearer task that help the receiver of the feedback achieve the goal \(“try using a recipe from this cooking book next time”\). Making progress feel real and attainable goes a long way!

3. **Expresses a point of view rather than an absolute truth.**

   Remember that your feedback represents a point of view, one that he recipient may not necessarily agree with. Don’t back yourself into a corner by presenting your opinions as fact, and allow the recipient to respond.

   Criticism and praise should ultimately be viewed as being the same so being objective about your thoughts nurtures a two way conversation which is less about ‘_good and bad_’ and more about ‘_improvement and how to get there_’.

4. **It should show respect for the recipient and is a two-way conversation.**

   As has been outlined in the other three points, acting on feedback can break down when viewed as an order or directive by the recipient. Always nurture the idea of feedback as a collaboration. Respect their thoughts and be prepared to shift your stance at times.
