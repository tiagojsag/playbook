# Feedback Loops at Vizzuality: Acting on Feedback

## _Overview_

The idea here is to lay out a set of principles that should be universally applied when giving and taking feedback, regardless of the context that feedback is being given or received, and should be used as a guideline for both participants in the process.

## Nurturing a Culture

The goals are:

* Everyone is comfortable and open.
* We address challenges together.
* We have clear expectations.
* There's no such thing as a stupid question.
* There are ongoing positive and/or corrective processes for everyone.
* We all make it a priority to improve each other and the whole organization. 

Every day, we should aim to improve ourselves, the company, and offer useful feedback to our peers.

## When to request Feedback

If you feel like you haven't had any feedback in a while \(_&gt; 1 week_\) then it's on you to seek it.

This can be as simple as approaching one of your peers or your PM about the work you've been doing recently.

Also, try to be specific about what _exactly_ you want feedback about? Refer to the [Giving Feedback doc](giving_feedback.md) for help here.

## Receiving Feedback and Acting on it Effectively

These principles are focused on how to act during/after receiving feedback in order for the process to be impacful:

1. **Clarify**

   Summarise the plan, do you know where you are now and where you need to be to improve? Do you fully understand what is the downside of the current approach/behavior, its negative impact, and do you agree that it can be improved? If any points seems unresolved, be open to ask about them explicitly, or if appropriate, revise them. Be open to asking for help of other people, who may have dealt with and overcome similar situations in the past.

2. **Outlining Next Steps**

   As soon as possible afterwards, outline the steps you are going to take to act on the feedback given. If you prefer, discuss this during feedback. If there are multiple components, specify each one and how you will achieve each. Identify when and how follow-up will occur and be as specific as possible. Set a time frame for achieving the primary goal and, if appropriate, identify smaller goals along the way. Make some rough notes to help you remember!

3. **Following Up & Bridging the Gap**

   On the agreed schedule, meet with the person that gave you feedback and evaluate the progress so far. Check if you were able to meet your goals, and if not, work together on a revised strategy. Review any potential negative side-effects of your strategy, and adapt your plan if needed. If it’s the case, review your next steps and timeline, making sure all of them are clear and achievable.

4. **Self Assessing & Feeding Forward**

   Review how you improved. After a feedback the feedback process went, how it went, and monitor how follow-up is progressing. The learning process doesn’t finish when the feedback session closes, this principle is basic and has impact on your colleagues and direct reports, and everyone on the team benefits.
