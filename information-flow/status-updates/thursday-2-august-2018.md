# Information flow

In the last few days, we have been collecting the feedback from vizzcamp and we now have a plan of going forward.

Our conclusion collecting the feedback.

Our concepts

  - transparency
  - reliability
  - accessibility
  - productivity

have overall been validated, but we have been too abstract. We focused on too many topics and looking at other groups at vizzcamps we saw that they were focusing on a handful of concrete topics and giving concrete solutions for those.

## Our plan going forward

Focusing on solving the most important issues: **mainly project communications** (we’ll touch upon other things as well)

Let’s not reinvent the wheel! **Doing an archeology of existing guidelines to see what has been documented previously in vizzuality**

what we have found is that there are plenty and plenty of guidelines already exist, so the question is:

Why are these previous guidelines not followed? there is a lot of great information already written. but for some reason, there is no action taken on a lot of these guidelines.


### solutions we need to find

- How to make people read and implement the guidelines?
- define ownership of these documents?
- create templates so information is easy to navigate/read
- make documentation fun! how can we make this information fun to read/write and share

### Meeting actions

we have now split into 2 groups

One group working on synthesizing and improving the existing guidelines.

One group is thinking of concrete strategies to implement these guidelines.


We hope that this action will make us land some concrete solutions and guidelines how to approach information flow.
