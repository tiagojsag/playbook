We want our clients to feel happy working with us, and if possible they feel like working with us more, and to do that, we should know their measure their satisfaction. This section is about how we understand our clients feelings, if they feel we took care of them, reach their project needs, meet deadlines, the quality was the expected one and other things.

During the process of a project, we had a lot of conversations with our clients, we did reviews every once in a while, team meetings, follow-ups, put a bunch of to-do’s in Basecamp and so on. Hopefully, we will also run retrospectives when we finish the project that should be very valuable and give us the pulse of how the whole thing went on. But we want to go one step further, and we want to ask our clients more intimately, what they felt, not just our own hypothesis because we want to improve the way we work next time. Here we have certain tools that we might use to learn more on every project we run.

The first one of these tools is a form that we can customise depending on the project, we can use this one as a template where we ask direct questions that we want to answer. We should select who should be the best people involved in the project to answer this questions and define if we have to create different surveys depending on our different targets.
