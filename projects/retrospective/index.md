## **Retrospectives.**

## Thinking back to do better

This document aims to be a set of guidelines, do’s and don’ts for us to follow and be best aligned in how we run retrospectives.

### Purpose.

Looking back is always a good way to learn and improve from our experience. The main objective of a retrospective is to improve the way we work together, but below there is a list of more outcomes you can get.

### Outcome from a Retrospective.

* Review our processes.
* Detect areas of improvement.
* Detect issues in the project to solve them before they go wild. 
* Detect good things we want to keep.
* Align team members. 
* Identify new opportunities for future phases.

### When should you do a retrospective?

We don’t need to reach the end of the project or come to a place where people seem to be detached from the project to run a retrospective. Run a retrospective:

* At the end of the project. Wait some days after the release but don’t postpone it too long. A week after the release seems like good timing. 
* When a milestone has been accomplished. Such as when an ongoing project has had a clear release, or at the end of the quarter / six months...
* You feel things are not working the best they could while we are working on the project. 

## Process for a Retrospective.

There are millions of ways to run a retrospective. Below is a procedure we have tested many times in different situations but you can adapt as needed. Here you have some general ideas you might want to take into account:

Prepare the session in advance. Look for a quiet and private space. Be sure you have the tools you need and people know what this is about so they can get ready for it. If there are people joining remotely, think about the technology you need.

Ask someone to be the facilitator. That person will make sure everybody talks and express their ideas. Also, they will take notes during the session and will develop the conclusions document. The facilitator can be someone in the team or a special guest but in any case, that person will need background information about the project to better follow the conversation. Ideally they would not have worked directly on the project, so they can provide an outside perspective.

For larger groups, consider to ask someone else to take notes besides the facilitator.

Make sure everybody knows the subject and the objectives of the session. You can send an email beforehand and always go through them at the beginning of the session.

Make sure to be positive in communicating. It’s about sharing what we could improve next time, in positive way we can learn from. It is not about blaming anyone or going into negative discussions. The goal is to improve, not to annoy people.

Make sure to reach out to introverts. Not everyone is comfortable speaking to groups, so use your means to involve them, by asking questions and putting them at ease; ignoring them is not a good idea.

Keeping up positive language and stressing the fact we are doing this to learn from ourselves can help to create a better atmosphere. As suggested in the project evaluation document, getting the team to answer some questions ahead of time \(using a survey\) could also help people contribute.

Make sure to keep to the time and be organized. Set a “schedule” for the retrospective to ensure it moves forward. Depending on the number of participants, the duration of the session can be around 1.5 or 2 hours.

Make sure the action points are clear and achievable so that they can be done!

Stress also what worked well during the project. It is also good to reinforce what we do well to keep it for the next time.

Tell the whole team what happened so we can all learn from the experience

### The classic retrospective...

## The setup

This is an example of how to run the restrospective that has work in the past.

* Invite everyone involved in the project to take part in the retrospective;
* Invite someone that was not involved in the project to coordinate the retrospective;
* If the discussion group is larger than 6 people, think about inviting someone to come as lead note-taker.
* Book a room to do the retrospective for between 1 hour to 2 hours depending on the size of the subject at hand;
* You might want to get some snacks so people can eat while they chat \(makes for a more relaxed environment\);
* If you are the coordinator, ask everyone to think ahead about the focus of the retrospective and add their ideas to a shared doc \(you might want to use this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14CqpvNFVATPjhLoj--Ognf902Fr6GaKZxDQE4pEQ_yU)\) before the Retrospective meeting. Set a limit of ~160 characters per comment to force people to express one idea at a time. Take into account those ideas will be presented later during the meeting and they can explain further then.

1- Think of up to three things that that we could've done better to avoid each of them. Add them to the shared doc

2- Think of up to three things that went well and how we could keep them the next time. Add them to the shared doc

3- Think about something that you, personally, could've done better to avoid unpleasant situations. Add them to the shared doc.

* If you set up personal Pledges at the beginning of the project, ask team members to think about how it went.
* People can keep their comments anonymous if you prefer.
* The coordinator should arrange all the comments and create a presentation to be followed during the meeting. It is useful to arrange them by topics as well. \(You can use a Trello Board\)

## During the retrospective

1. Welcome everyone;
2. Identify what the retrospective is about and what the goal of the meeting is;
3. Identify the facilitator of the retrospective and let them have the floor;
4. Identify the note taker if any.
5. To include everybody in the conversation, you can start by having a quick round asking each team member "How do you feel today?"
6. Start the discussion following the comments previously shared.
7. Drive the conversation to identify actions to avoid the same issues in the future.
8. If you notice some people are not speaking much ask open questions to the quieter ones to make sure everyone has a chance to speak. Where people are speaking too much, mention that \("I'd like to hear from some others in the room"\)
9. Action points to tackle the priorities are identified;
10. Thank you and see you next time!

## After the Retrospective

_Distill actions_

After the meeting, coordinator will take all the notes and create a document with clear actions that will help us to improve our processes.

Think about naming a responsible person for each action and a potential deadline if that makes sense.

_Pledges_

Ask each team member to create a "Pledge" for themselves and add them to Bamboo as objective for the quarter. This way, we ensure individual commitment is tracked.

_Guidelines review_

We might detect areas of improvement of our guidelines. If so, be sure you name a responsible to update them.

_Long term review_

_\[This is a Work In Progress still\]_

Every year, a couple of volunteers will review all those documents \(_create a folder and link it here_\) to see if there is any evolution. Where we see common issues that need improving, or some "things to keep" that should be shared, there'll be a all-company presentation during all-hands to start a discussion, and a working group can form to amend or improve relevant guidelines.

## Very important things

* Make sure to be positive in communicating. It's not about not sharing what went wrong, is not blaming anyone and not going into negative discussions. The goal is to improve, not to get people annoyed;
* Make sure to reach out for introverts, not everyone is comfortable speaking to groups, so use your means to involve them, by asking questions and putting them at ease; Ignoring them is not a good idea;
* Make sure to keep to the time and organized. Set a "schedule" for the retrospective to ensure it moves forward;
* Make sure the action points are clear and achievable so that they can be done!

## Final Thoughts

As we said before, retrospectives can be run in many different ways, here you have some links for inspiration: A more playful schema: [http://toolbox.hyperisland.com/check-in-questions](http://toolbox.hyperisland.com/check-in-questions) An idea to mix-up with feedback: [http://toolbox.hyperisland.com/feedback-start-stop-continue](http://toolbox.hyperisland.com/feedback-start-stop-continue)

A couple of things we thought in our last retrospective \(Half Earth\):

* Make people ask themselves at least one thing they’ve learnt!
* Linked to this idea that everyone committed in the Kick-off meeting they were going to learn while working on this project, it would be nice to see the progress and let them talk about it.
* It would be nice to ask people to assess and express one thing they could have done better in this project that will probably be turned into a commitment for the next project they start working on. 

Another couple of things we thought in our last perspective \(Worldbank\):

* Just one hour might not be enough if the group is more than 4 people.
* Ensure everybody share their thoughts.
* It was a good idea to ask people to share their comments beforehand and organize them in thematic areas.
