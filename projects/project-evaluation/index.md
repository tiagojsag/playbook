# Project evaluation

All projects will be evaluated by Vizzuality and the client. These evaluations will be used to calculate a score to track project quality and client satisfaction, and we will share these scores openly.

## Objective

To find ways to improve how we work and inform the decisions we make by critically assessing our projects.

## Introduction

All projects will be evaluated using identical criteria. They will be scored on a numeric scale (1 to 5, where a lower value relates to undesirable attributes), and allowing for comments (using this spreadsheet). The guidelines below are provided to reduce ambiguity around particular criteria.

The evaluation is intended to fit within a project's life cycle, and integrate with existing practices at distinct phases of a project. However, to kick-start the process, we will short-circuit that for the first iteration and evaluate all ongoing projects at the same time.

## Criteria

### Timeliness

_“Were agreed milestones delivered on time?”_
   
**Who:** This evaluation should be performed by the Project Manager
   
**How:** Based on contracted / actual delivery date
   
**Question:** Have agreed deadlines been kept?
   
1 (Behind schedule) 3 (On time) 5 (Ahead of time)
   
**Other questions to consider:**
- Were the project milestones delivered on time?
- If the milestones were not accomplished: why?

**Frequency/When:**
- End of project. 
- At the time of major releases.

### Product quality

_“Would you show the project to your peers? (including the code)”_

**Who:** Team; PM + Technical Lead + Designer

**How:** Guided discussion during retrospective. The individuals involved in the project can score it individually, and return the average score.

**Question:** Did the product reach its expected quality? Would the team show it to their peers?

1 (Below expectations) 3 (Expected quality) 5 (Above expectations)

**Other questions to consider:**
- Did the final product reach its objectives?
- Did the project accumulate technical debt? 

**Frequency/When:** End of project

### Client satisfaction

**Who:** Client; (PM to send the evaluation)

**How:** Survey
**Question:** How likely is the client to recommend our services to a peer?

1 (Very Unlikely) →  5 (Very likely)

**Other questions to consider:**
- Communication: 
    - Was it clear who to contact in our team?
    - Were you happy with your interactions with our team members? 
    - Please rate the professionalism of our team with whom you interacted.  
- Support:
    - Did we reply to your queries and request in a timely manner? 
    - Did we give your issues enough attention? 
- Product:
    - Were you happy with the final product? 
    - Did we add value to the product beyond your expectations?
    - How likely are you to seek our services in the future? 
    - How likely are you to recommend our services to a peer?

**Frequency/When:** End of project. 

### BD value

**Who:** BD Team

**How:** Numerical data

**Question:** Does the project offer business development value?

1 (Low) →  5 (High)

**Other questions to consider:**
- What is the likelihood this project will lead more work with the current project team?
- What is the likelihood this project will lead to work with a different project team, and how big will the new project be?

**Frequency/When:** Quarterly across all projects

### Team value

_“How happy were you with the process?”_

**Who:** Team; PM + Technical Lead + Designer to seed the evaluation (initial phase); whole team eventually

**How:** Anonymous survey to be filled in before the retrospective, and to be discussed in the Retrospective. This survey can also be used to help guide the Retrospective discussion.

**Question:** What was the team’s experience of working on this project? How happy was the team with the process? Please explain why.

1 (Unhappy) → 5 (Very happy)

**Other questions to consider:**
- Was our experience working with the client positive?
- Were people given reasonable opportunity to learn and advance? (links to kick-off - pledges)
- Was the project technically relevant? 
- Were the project deadlines reasonable?
- Were project milestones and objectives clear?
- Did you receive sufficient support from your team and PM to do your job?
- Were you happy with the way the project was organized and executed?

**Frequency/When:** End of project.
