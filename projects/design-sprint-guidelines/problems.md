# What problems do we need to solve in this sprint?

## Useful for.
Putting all the team’s worries, concerns and unknowns together in one place, grouping them into key areas to discuss, and prioritising things to put in the agenda. This works best 

## How to do it.
Everyone gets some post-its, and 5 minutes to write out some of their questions. After 5 minutes we’ll start adding the questions. As we add postits, we will start to group them based on themes that emerge. At the end of the session we run a voting exercise - what are the top topics we need to cover? Which ones can wait?

**Time needed:** 40 minutes (2 minutes setup, 5 minutes thinking, 18 minutes presenting, 15 minutes grouping and prioritising).
