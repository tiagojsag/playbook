# Describing this project

## Useful for. 
Understanding the objectives of the site, the tone of the site, messaging. 

## How to do it. 
Give everyone a stack of post-its and a pen. Ask them to think of adjectives they would use to describe the project. Is it fun, serious, rigorous, influential, disruptive? When everyone’s had about 5 minutes, get them to read them out one-by-one, and start grouping them around themes as they arise. We use postits so that the groups can keep shifting and changing as each additional person comes. 

**A good example.** Public Safety Assessment. [See the pictures we took](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1oKo5xDYwPjkaCJC3QLcH8khOY_d52rvq) and the [write-up](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UnfFvdkdGdEdN1tvgJlHCHJ7KaKMjTYi_LjCt4U0wKI/edit#heading=h.e9z7fk7dz3m4). 

**Time needed.** 25 minutes (2 mins setup, 5 mins thinking, 18 mins presenting and grouping)
