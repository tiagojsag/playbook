# Creating Personas

## Useful for.
Learning about who the key users are, their needs and their capacities/ skills. Getting a whole team to empathise with who we’re building for. 

## How to do it. 
First identify 2-4 key user personas, ideally ahead of the workshop. Split the group into 2-4 smaller groups, making sure there’s a good mix of Vizzuality vs client in each small group. Each group takes one persona and fills in a template. [We have a template here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cl2HOUn25boeAYiy4IUBcdOhfHj6WNdD1f5MxqXJA74/edit) Vizz staff should help the client talk about the people they know who fit that persona, and keep questioning their statements to get richer information. 

**A good example.** [Mozilla workshop](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B9iu7Qcff3aBQ3FSNlk0dTNfNVk) or Empathy Maps at PSA workshop. See [description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A_7hgCwA2M679u4fD9BtXgUEDmY28Ep8FLBgCIGwYZ4/edit#heading=h.is84is9cnzlh) and [outcomes](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1fmref94Gk908sUqNTAaOQ4cNHDKp6L7J)

**Time needed.** 50 minutes. 5 minutes to set up the activity, 15 minutes split into three groups, then 3 x 10 minute presentations of the personas.
