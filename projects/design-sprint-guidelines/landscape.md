# Landscape Analysis

## Useful for. 
Seeing what a client thinks is a ‘good’ or ‘bad’ website. Comparing our offering to other sites, in order to find our competitive advantage

## How to do it. 
Start by asking a simple question: “show me a few websites that are very similar to the site you want to build in this project”. This should show you their competitors. Then break the site we’re building into small pieces of functionality, and ask “show me a site you use that does this well”. Examples could include “show me sites that have checklists” or ‘show me sites with a good map”. All the time keep asking “what do you like about this”, “what can we learn from this”, “what can we improve on”.
