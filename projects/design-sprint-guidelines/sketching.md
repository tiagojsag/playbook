# Rapid Sketching

## Useful for.

Rapidly creating lots of different ways to solve a certain problem.

## How to do it.

First settle on a certain problem \(“how do users find interesting datasets”\) or a page you want to try and prototype \(home page, map page\). Everyone in the group gets a piece of A4 paper. Fold it in half 2 times, then back out again - you should have a page with 4 segments. You have 10 minutes to sketch 4 different ways to solve that problem/ lay out that page.

**A good example.** WB Maps [pictures of the sketches we made](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1WvCIKXvSgFTMOmoyqYV8WcTdBTo-tOoa) and [agenda we followed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvXBJRyBKdxLtAnHPrMQ9xVjJCp2HGBvrvsSZW2u_14/edit)

**Time needed.** 50 minutes. 5 minutes to set up, 10 minutes to think, 20 minutes to present, 15 minutes to vote and discuss
