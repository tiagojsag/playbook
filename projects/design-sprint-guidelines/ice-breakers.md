# Ice Breakers

## Useful for. 
Meeting some new colleagues, getting everyone to talk and helping create a happy, excited, creative air. 

## How to do it.

There's a number of different options available, here's some of the ones we've used in the past.

- **Introduce a colleague.** Each person, in turn, has to introduce the person to their left. 

- **60 second drawing a partner**. We put the names of every participant in a hat. everyone picks a name from the hat, then has 60 seconds to draw them. We collect all the papers at the end and we have to guess who was drawn

- **20 circles drawing exercise.** Each person is given a blank paper with twenty (or even 30) identical circles drawn on it. In a certain period of time, they have to draw as many things (baseball, pizza, world) as they can in each circle.

- **Post-it paper airplane**. Each team has to make a paper airplane that will fly farther than their opponents' out of post-its in 3 minutes. The catch, they can't communicate with each other verbally. After time is up, a rep from each team comes up to the stage to fly their plane.

- **Rock paper scissors tournament;** if you lose (best 2 of 3) you have to become the winner's biggest fan in the next round. By the end you have two people battling with about 15 people cheering for them. 

- **Jeopardy** - select a random word (using wikipedia random function) and say it aloud to the group. That is the answer, but we don’t have a question. Each person takes it in turn to suggest what the question could be. So for the word ‘Apple’ questions could be “how did the witch kill snow white”, “what’s the richest company in the world” or “what’s my least favourite fruit”...

- **Exquisite surrealist cadavers** - this exercise is about creativity and teamwork. Everyone has a piece of paper folded in 3 parts going down the page. The first person draws on the top fold. They then pass to the next person with the top half hidden; they draw the 2nd piece without knowing what they’re adding to. They then pass to the next person with the top and middle hidden; they draw the third piece. They finally pass to a fourth person, who has to describe the ‘thing’ that has been created.
