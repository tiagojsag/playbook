# What content should be on this site?

## Useful for.

Getting consensus from client and with the team about the key things that need to be on the site, and which are less priority/ stretch goals.

## How to do it.

Nominate one scribe. Get a big whiteboard, wall or flipchart. Ask people to ‘tell me contents that need to be on the site’. Note we’re looking for pieces of content \(datasets, information, types of visualisation etc\) rather than pages \(needs a home page, needs a map page\) - we could combine these different pieces of information in multiple ways later. So the idea here is just to understand everything we could possibly put on it.

After some time and the ideas start to dry up, run a voting exercise. First, let the client Star any item that is absolutely mandatory \(legal, donor requirement etc\). Then everyone gets about 5 stars to add to different things; note we are looking for “most interesting or useful for the key personas” not “the thing you’re most interested in”.

**A good example.** PSA [notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1DAoxLXuO4gzlpCEMmvY0e6fN3iF0sVZS) and LHI [pics in this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Lxx39Ka8yhlZiPBBDDHrbZ5WpZmNg-RC)

**Time needed.** 20 minutes \(2 mins setup, 10 mins creating it, 8 mins refining\)
