# Adding Google Analytics

* Step 1 - decide if weâ€™re creating a new analytics account or using an existing account held by client.
* Step 2a - if create new, get someone to set up and provide tracking code \(doesn't have to be Jamie - we all have analytics accounts with our Vizzuality email address!\)
* Step 2b - if use existing, get the tracking code and install on the site
* Step 3 - invite relevant people from vizz \(definitely Martin and Jamie\)/ client to the account so they can access the data
* Step 4 - think through custom events you want to track \(GA tracks pages by standard, but not button clicks etc\)

For an example of the custom, [take a look at this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bpUlD7lAp5LpTzemAUkloLodiypQjTYWfDqiWerkVHE/edit#gid=0) we put together for Global Forest Watch country pages
