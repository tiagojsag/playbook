#Yes and.

##Useful for.
Thinking of creative or innovative ways to deliver a certain feature. 

##How to do it. 
Using the results of the [what content activity](/projects/sprint-guidelines/content), you should have a set of features/ contents that should be on the site. Split them amongst a couple of small groups (2-3 people each) and then run the activity. Put the feature/ content as a postit at the top of a wall/ whiteboard. Then, between the 2 or 3 of you, extend that idea by saying “yes and…”. 

EG if a feature is “Impact visualisation”, the yes ands could be 
- “yes and it’s built with the New York Times datavizz team for mass exposure”
- “yes and it’s added to giphy so people can share an animation of it”
- "yes and we find ways to incorporate that data into other Vizzuality projects for the biggest reach possible"

**A good example.** [Mozilla](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B9iu7Qcff3aBUzhGVGJqdmVnM28)

**Time needed.** As long as you need. In the Mozilla workshop we spent 5 minutes setting up, 30 minutes in groups (3 features each to do yes and with), then an hour presenting and discussing.
