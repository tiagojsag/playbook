#What is the metaphor/ concept behind this site?

##Useful for. 
Working out Information Architecture and key principles to consider when thinking about how different features relate to each other. 

##How to do it. 
Give everyone a few postits/ pieces of paper and ask them to think about a concept or metaphor that describes the website for them. For example, is it a tree: something with lots of hidden roots, a single main visible part and lots of branches. Or is it a Laboratory; a place to experiment, create new knowledge? Give everyone 5 minutes or so to think of ideas, then ask them to present one by one. After all the ideas we have a round of questions and voting to see the concepts which best capture what we’re aiming for.

**A good example.** [Mozilla](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B9iu7Qcff3aBSjdhQ25TWEZxaFU) and [PSA](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1vWFCMzil_6NndzPfF989y2ZgZ68gNBeu).
 
**Time needed.** 35 minutes. 2 minutes to set up, 5 minutes thinking, 18 minutes presenting and thinking, 10 minutes voting
