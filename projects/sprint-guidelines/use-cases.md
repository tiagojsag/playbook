#Creating Use Cases

##Useful for. 
Getting the client to think a bit more about how the tool will be used and the impacts we want to generate from different audiences using the tool. It should also help them prioritise th must haves with the nice to haves. 

##How to do it. 
This should build on a discussion about personas. Do that first before this. Each use case has a certain structure: “As a [insert persona name], I want to [action to perform on site], in order to [objective they want to achieve]”. Give everyone 5-6 post it notes, and 5 minutes to think through the most important use cases (for them). We’ll then go round the table and ask everyone to present, in turn, what they’ve put. Where we have similar post-its, we can group them together as they’re presented. We can then do a round of voting to see which use cases are most important for us to focus on. 

**A good example.** I2I workshop [see pics here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B9iu7Qcff3aBMmdTNU1oWEdFWjQ)
**Time needed.** 45 minutes. 5 minutes to set up, 5 minutes thinking, 20 minutes presenting and grouping, 15 minutes voting/ prioritising.
