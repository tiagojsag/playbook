#User journeys

##Useful for. 
Working out the steps users need to take, from getting to your site through to achieving their goal. Finding the pain points (to avoid) and the moments of happiness and joy that will make them want to keep exploring/ come back. 

##How to do it. 
Start at the user’s goal. What do they want to achieve? Put this out on the far right of a whiteboard. Now put the user on the far left, and start talking through their journey. How do they know about the site, how do they get there, how do they get through the site? And what are they thinking as they go through the site? 

**A good example.** None yet
**Time needed.** ? Perhaps 20 minutes for each persona, do 3, so an hour.
