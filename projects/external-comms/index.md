# **External Comms.**

We love talking about our work and hope you do too. We’ve prepared some advice for you if you want to know when and how to talk about our projects.

# Talking to the public. 

## Who are we and what do we do? 

Vizzuality is a mission-driven design and technology agency that creates bespoke, compelling data visualisations and digital tools that inspire learning, catalyse new decisions and improve our world. With a strong commitment to working in partnership with world-leading organisations, our experienced team of engineers, designers, data scientists and researchers has worked with the likes of The White House, NASA, the United Nations, the Stockholm Environment Institute, Google, and the World Resources Institute. Our work often bridges the gap between policy, science and citizens, helping people understand complex information and use it in their decision-making.

## Our persona. 

When we write and talk about ourselves as a company, we use a particular tone and style that reflects Vizzuality personality. [Our persona is called Andi](https://docs.google.com/a/vizzuality.com/document/d/1GM38FaggV94gHVbQYp9olxOotBgbg3FRJv3ni33DkgY/edit?usp=sharing). 

If you write or speak as ‘Vizzuality’ you should talk like Andi. 

If you are writing as yourself, express your personality in a way that reflects Vizzuality’s ethos. 

Want more writing advice? Contact Camellia.

## Project promotion.

When a project is live and the client is ready to promote it, we want to promote it too.

Typically, when a project goes public we:

* Publish a blog about the website/tool/app and explain what it’s for, why it’s different, and explain the issue it addresses. 

* Publish a blog about the technology or design techniques we used to build it. 

* Publish a project page for our website.

* Share links on social media to our blog and any articles written by the client or media. 

When a project is nearing launch please do the following:

* Tell Camellia about the project launch and what date it is going public on.

* Introduce Camellia to the client and say we’d like to help them promote the application that’s going public. 

## Responding to media enquiries. 

If you are approached by a journalist, tell Camellia. Even if the enquiry has nothing to do with Vizzuality, tell her. We are happy for you to talk to the media but keep us informed so we can help you answer questions about Vizzuality and share the article when it’s published. 

## Interviews.

We are happy for you to do interviews but please tell us if you are approached. Ask the person that’s asked for an interview to send you a link to it once it’s published. 

## Social media.

We love talking about what we do and we hope you do too. As soon as a client starts talking about our work publically, so can you. If you aren’t sure if you can tweet about something you are working on, ask the project PM for advice. We encourage you to share articles, advice or thoughts on the topics you are interested in. 

## Our social media channels.

**Twitter:** Follow us @Vizzuality and tag us when you talk about our work.

**Facebook:** Like our [page](https://www.facebook.com/vizzuality/) and share our posts with your friends.

**LinkedIn:** Follow our company page on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/434611/) and list the projects you work on in your profile. Add a link to the relevant Vizzuality [project page](http://vizzuality.com/) and add a short description about your role.  

## Conferences.

When you attended a conference, you are representing Vizzuality but be yourself and let your passions and interests shine. We don’t go to conferences to give boring powerpoint slides—we go to them to meet interesting people, make new contacts, and spark leads that lead to new work, collaborations and teammates. 

### Presentations.

When we talk at conferences, we want to inspire them and show them what’s possible when you combine data and design. We have a presentation template you should use to prepare your slides but if you need some design advice, talk to Sergio or Dani.

If you want to improve your presentation techniques, talk to Craig and he can share his tips on how to establish a relationship with an audience and get them laughing.
